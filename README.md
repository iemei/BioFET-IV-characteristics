# BioFET-IV-characteristics

The BioFET used in this experiment is called Meta-Nano Channel (MNC) BioFET. 
The MNC BioFETs were fabricated with Tower Semiconductor mass production RF CMOS SOI platform. 
The devices were formed on the thin device layer of a 200 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. 
The 145 nm silicon device layer was located on top of a 0.4 μm buried oxide (BOX) layer. 
The device layer was doped with a ≈3 × 10^17 cm–3 phosphorous with a certain gradient from the top to bottom surfaces. 
Four electrodes were formed in the device layer. Source and drain n+ regions were highly doped with Arsenic (7 × 10^19 cm–3). Two lateral p+ gates were doped with Boron 2 × 10^20 cm−3. The p+ gates were formed in a self-aligned way using 200 nm thick Polysilicon on top of a 5.5 nm SiO2 gate dielectric. The same polysilicon (p-doped) layer was used to define the two transverse gates parallel to source and drain regions of the n-channel. 
The channel length was 10 μm and the space between the p+ diffusion regions range from 0.5 to 1 μm for different devices. 
A trench having a width of 0.6 μm was etched at the end of the process flow to expose the active sensing area (gate dielectric).
The estimated cost of a silicon MNC chip in high-volume production was in the range of $0.5.
